What is Happening With Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Right Now? 

What is Medicaid?

Medicaid provides health coverage to over 86 million* Americans, including eligible 

low-income adults

, 

children

, 

pregnant women

, 

elderly adults 

and 

people with disabilities

. States may choose to cover additional groups.

Medicaid is the single

 largest source of health insurance coverage 

in the United States.

Each state runs their own Medicaid program. 

Medicaid may be called by a 

different name depending on the state

. For example, in [Tennessee], the Medicaid program is called [TennCare].

What is the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP)?

The Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to over 7 million*

uninsured children

 in low

-

income families.

Similar to Medicaid, 

each state runs their own 

CHIP program.

CHIP programs may also be called by a 

different name depending on the state

. For example, in [Georgia], CHIP is called [PeachCare].

Why are Medicaid and CHIP Renewals Happening Now?

For the past three years, people on Medicaid were not required to renew their coverage due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. This was referred to as the continuous enrollment condition.

The continuous enrollment condition ended on March 31, 2023, and as of April 1, 2023, states are able to terminate Medicaid and CHIP enrollment for individuals no longer eligible. 

States will have up to 12 months to return to normal eligibility and enrollment operations.

The expiration of the continuous enrollment condition now presents the single largest health coverage transition event since the first open enrollment period of the Health Insurance Marketplace.

What Is Happening Right Now With Medicaid and CHIP?

States are now contacting individuals 

to determine if they are still eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. 

Some individuals might not qualify for Medicaid or CHIP and will 

lose coverage

.

During a 12-month period, states will be 

spreading out renewals

. Not everyone will have their Medicaid or CHIP coverage renewed at the same time.

How Will This Impact People in My Community?

About 

15 million 

people are predicted to 

lose Medicaid and CHIP 

coverage over the next year. Of that, 

6.8 million 

people are expected to lose coverage 

even though they still qualify 

for Medicaid and CHIP.

5.3 million children 

are predicted to lose their Medicaid or CHIP coverage.

Nearly 

4.6 million 

people predicted to lose coverage are 

Latino

 and 

2.2 million 

people are 

Black.

People enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP need 

to 

take

 

steps to renew

 their coverage, if eligible.

People who no longer qualify for Medicaid or CHIP will need to find another option for health insurance coverage.

What Do People Enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP Have to Do to Renew Their Coverage?

States will use the information they have to decide if a person or their family member(s) will keep their Medicaid or CHIP coverage

.

If the state 

needs more information

, they will send a 

renewal letter 

to that person in the mail.

For some people, this will be the 

first time 

their coverage will be renewed. 

M

any people may not know that they need to renew their coverage or be on the 

look

 out for information from their state.



What Steps Do People Need to Take if They Have Not Gotten Anything From Their State Medicaid or CHIP Program Yet?

Update your contact information 

 Make sure your state Medicaid or CHIP program has your current mailing address, phone number, email, or other contact information. This way, theyll be able to contact you about your Medicaid or CHIP coverage. [Insert state website and/or phone number]

Check your mail and open any mail from your state Medicaid or CHIP program - 

Your state Medicaid or CHIP program will mail you a letter about your Medicaid or CHIP coverage. This letter will also let you know if you need to complete a renewal form to see if you still qualify for Medicaid or CHIP. [insert name of your state program, if not called Medicaid]

What Steps Do People Need to Take if They Have Received a Renewal Form From Their State?

Read the entire letter! 

Complete your renewal form and send it back

 Fill out the form and return it to your state Medicaid or CHIP program right away to help avoid a gap in your Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Provide the information your state is asking for and any documents to support that information.

Even if a parent 

is

 no longer 

eligible 

for Medicaid, their child may still be eligible

 

for Medicaid or CHIP. It is important to 

always

 return the renewal form so your state can see if you or anyone in your family qualifies for coverage.

Look out for follow-up 

information

 from your

 state about your coverage 

 State Medicaid and CHIP offices will follow-up with people once they have reviewed a persons information to share if their coverage has been renewed. States will also let 

people 

know if they found that a 

person 

is no longer eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and when their coverage will end.

What Steps Do People Need to Take if They Have Lost Their Medicaid or CHIP Coverage?

Review the notice from your state to see why you lost Medicaid or CHIP coverage 

If the state ended your coverage because they did not have the information they needed to complete the renewal, then you can contact your state to provide the missing information. Find your states contact information at 

Medicaid.gov/renewals

.

If the state ended your coverage because they found that you are no longer eligible for the program, you will need to find another option for health coverage.

Appeal the decision or re-apply for Medicaid or CHIP

If you think that you are still eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and the state wrongly ended your coverage, you can ask the state for a second review and appeal the decision.

If there is a change in your situation (ex: your income changes), you can reapply for Medicaid or CHIP at any time. Visit 

Medicaid.gov 

to find out how you can contact your state to re-apply.
