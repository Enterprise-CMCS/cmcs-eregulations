# About

[![Parser Checks](https://github.com/Enterprise-CMCS/cmcs-eregulations/actions/workflows/parser-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Enterprise-CMCS/cmcs-eregulations/actions/workflows/parser-checks.yml)

This is a project for the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) to meet needs of CMCS and State staff researching regulations and related guidance, building on the [eRegulations](https://eregs.github.io/) open source project.

We have public documentation about our product, design, and research processes in [this repository wiki](https://github.com/Enterprise-CMCS/cmcs-eregulations/wiki).

# Getting set up

## Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose
-   go version 1.16
-   git
-   node >= v18 (We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
-   pre-commit hooks

### Set up Git pre-commit hooks

See "Quick Start" in [SECRETSCANNING.md](SECRETSCANNING.md#quick-start) to ensure that pre-commit hooks are installed and working properly.

## Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/Enterprise-CMCS/cmcs-eregulations
```

## Create your Dockerfile

- Create the Dockerfile

```
cd solution
cp Dockerfile.template Dockerfile
```

- Update the Dockerfile with correct environment variables values

## Running eRegs

A lot of tasks for local development can be accessed through the Makefile.
Running `make` will provide some information about the available tasks.

For example:

```
cd solution
make local
```

## Create static assets

Running this will create all the static assets so that the admin page
has the proper CSS files to display properly.

```
cd solution
make local.collectstatic
```

Will start a local Docker environment and load parts of Title 42 into it.

Proceed to <http://localhost:8000> in your browser to see the results.

`make local.createadmin` will create an admin superuser for the admin portion of the site.

Proceed to <http://localhost:8000/admin> to access the admin portion and login with the credentials you created in the previous step.

`make local.seed` will load data from the fixtures folder setting up a usable amount of data for local use.  
This data is not maintained and should not be relied on for any purpose other than development.

`make local.stop` will cause the running Docker processes to stop without losing data.

`make local.clean` will remove the local environment completely, useful when you want to start fresh.

## Testing eRegs

#### Testing setup

Before running the tests for the first time, you may need to install Cypress dependencies.

1. Navigate to project root
2. `cd solutions/ui/e2e`
3. `npm install`

#### Running the tests

1. Navigate to project root
2. If project is not already running locally, run `make local`
3. For Cypress run `make test.cypress`. This will run our Cypress suite.
4. For Python unit tests, run `make test.pytest`. This will run our Python unittest using pytest.
5. For Vitest run `make test.vitest`.  This will run our Vitest suite.

## Working with assets

Navigate to project root.

`make watch-all`: SCSS and JS files can be watched and automatically compiled.

For admin site customizations, please use the icon set at [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com).

## Importing resource data

To populate the created database with seed data for resources, run the command below in the solution directory.

```
make local.seed
```

## Exporting data from production

If the data seems out of sync with production, you may want to get a more recent version of the data from production.

In order to update your local data with the most recent version of production, you will need to have access to our production database, pg_dump, and access to the CMS VPN.

You must also have postgres version 15. 

1. Connect to the VPN. 

2. Create a backup of the database you intend to restore using pg_dump. Execute the following command:

`pg_dump -U <DB_USER> -h <DB_HOST> -p <DB_PORT> <DB_NAME> > <name_you_want_your_backupfile_to_be>`

(Note: pg_restore also performs a backup of the database you intend to restore. However, as a precautionary measure, it's advisable to create a separate backup of your database.)

3. Next, run the script `/solution/backend/scripts/backup_db.sh`. You'll be prompted to provide the credentials for the production database.

4. Once the backup process is finished, you'll find a copy of the backup file in the directory where the command was executed. The file will be named in the following format: `<db host name>_<name of your db>_<date>.sql`.

5. With the backup file ready, proceed to restore the database by running the script `/solution/backend/scripts/restore_db.sh`.

6. Upon running the restoration script, you'll receive a prompt indicating that the existing database will be replaced. If you're certain, type yes.

7. Follow the subsequent prompts, providing the necessary credentials. When prompted for the backup file, enter the name of the file generated during the backup process.
8. Before the database is restored, a backup is created of the db that is being restored. The file will be named in the following format: `<db host name>_<name of your db>_<date>.sql`. 
a. Visit the local website and ensure that the data has been copied. 


### Adding a new model

If adding a new model, update the following files:

- In populate_content.py add it to both the add it to the fixtures list.  First part of it is the JSON file, the other is the model.
- In the make file, either add it to the list of objects, or add a new line for the model.
- In the emptyseedtables.py add the model to the handler command.

## Working with CMS Single-Sign-On

### Setting local to use CMS SSO (IDM)
Update your Dockerfile with the following environment variables:
```
ENV OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
ENV OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret>
ENV OIDC_OP_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT=<authorization endpoint>
ENV OIDC_OP_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=<token endpoint>
ENV OIDC_OP_USER_ENDPOINT=<user endpoint>
ENV OIDC_OP_JWKS_ENDPOINT=<jwks endpoint>
ENV EUA_FEATUREFLAG=<set to 'true' if you want to see the eua link on admin login page>
```
These values can be found on AWS Parameter Store.

### Register to test IDP IDM
- Sign into the URL [https://test.idp.idm.cms.gov/](https://test.idp.idm.cms.gov/) to access the CMS IDP (Identity Provider) portal.
- Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account. Follow the provided prompts and instructions to complete the MFA setup process.
- Once your account has been successfully set up with MFA, please notify the CMS Okta team.
- Inform the CMS Okta team that you need to be added to the eRegs group.

Please note that the provided URL (https://test.idp.idm.cms.gov/) may require a valid CMS IDP account to access.

### Troubleshooting tips
- Issue: Setting OIDC_OP_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT not found
  This error indicates that the environment variables are not properly set.
- Solution:
  - On your local environment verify that the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable is set to ${DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE:-cmcs_regulations.settings.euasettings}. You can modify your docker-compose.yml file to include this setting: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: ${DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE:-cmcs_regulations.settings.euasettings}.
  - On dev, val, prod ensure that DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is set correctly in AWS Param Store. 

## Serverless set up
We use serverless in conjunction with GitHub Actions to deploy our application to our various environments.

### Functions
To allow us to deploy our application to various environments and prohibit certain Lambda functions to be deployed to different environments, we split our Lambda functions out into a specific folder.  In backend/serverless_functions there is a different YML file for each environment.  When you want to add a Lambda function to each environment, add the function the corresponding environment folder.
