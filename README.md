# About

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/CMSgov/cmcs-eregulations/workflows/eCFR%20Parser%20Checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CMSgov/cmcs-eregulations/actions)

This is a project for the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) to meet needs of CMCS and State staff researching regulations and related guidance, building on the [eRegulations](https://eregs.github.io/) open source project.

We have public documentation about our product, design, and research processes in [this repository wiki](https://github.com/CMSgov/cmcs-eregulations/wiki).

# Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- go version 1.16
- git
- node >= v15 (We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

# Getting setup

## Getting the code ##

```
git clone https://github.com/cmsgov/cmcs-eregulations
```

## Running eRegs ##

A lot of tasks for local development can be accessed through the Makefile.
Running `make` will provide some information about the available tasks.

For example:

```
make local
```

Will start a local docker environment and load parts of Title 42 into it.

Proceed to <http://localhost:8000> in your browser to see the results.

`make local.createadmin` will create an admin superuser for the admin portion of the site.

Proceed to <http://localhost:8000/admin> to access the admin portion and login with the credentials you created in the previous step

`make local.seed` will load data from the fixtures folder setting up a usable amount of data for local use.  
This data is not maintained and should not be relied on for any purpose other than development.

`make local.stop` will cause the running docker processes to stop without losing data.

`make local.clean` will remove the local environment completely, useful when you want to start fresh.

## Testing eRegs ##

#### Testing Setup ####

Before running the tests for the first time, you may need to install cypress dependencies.

1. `cd e2e`
2. `npm install`

#### Running the tests ####

Running `make test` after `make local` will run the cypress suite of end to end tests.

1. Navigate to project root
2. If project is not already running locally, run `make local`
3. `make test`

## Working with assets ##

`make watch`: scss and js files can be watched an automatically compiled

## Exporting data from Production ##

Every type of model has an "Export to JSON" button that will export the data to a JSON format that can be easily imported
by saving the file to the fixtures folder and importing it with the built in `loaddata` command from Django.

## Running eRegs Prototype ##

To better support Rapid Prototyping, a VueJS Single Page Application (SPA) has been created using the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

1. `make prototype` to spin up Docker container
2. visit `localhost:8081` to view prototype
3. edit files in `/regulations/static/prototype` to make changes
4. changes should be reflected in running prototype via hot reloading
5. `make prototype:clean` to tear down Docker container

## Hygen Templates ##

In order to enhance development speed and quality this project has introduced [hygen templates](http://www.hygen.io/).
The website lists a few ways to install hygen.  Once you have installed hygen you will be able to execute templates to create code.
Hygen templates are located in solution/_templates.  Inside the _templates directory the files are organized like this:

    .
    ├── solution               
    │   ├── _templates          
    │       ├──generator
    │       │  └──foo
    │       │     ├──myFile.js.ejs.t
    │       │     ├──otherFile.js.ejs.t
    │       │     └-─folder
    │       │        ├──template.html.ejs.t
    │       │        └──package.json.ejs.t        
    │       └── generator2                
    │           └── ...
    └── ...

In this example generator has a single command called foo so to run this template you would need to run
```bash
$ hygen generator foo
```
This would then be expected to create or alter myFile.js and otherFile.js in the root directory.  In addition it
would be expected to create or alter folder/template.html and folder/package.json.  
For more in depth explanations on how hygen works their website has comprehensive documentation.
